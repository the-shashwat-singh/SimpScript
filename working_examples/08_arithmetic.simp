# Basic arithmetic examples

# Addition
a = 5
b = 3
c = a + b
shownl "5 + 3 = " + c

# Subtraction
d = a - b
shownl "5 - 3 = " + d

# Multiplication
e = a * b
shownl "5 * 3 = " + e

# Division
f = a / b
shownl "5 / 3 = " + f

# Modulo
g = a % b
shownl "5 % 3 = " + g

# Compound expressions
h = (a + b) * (a - b)
shownl "(5 + 3) * (5 - 3) = " + h

# Order of operations
i = a + b * a
shownl "5 + 3 * 5 = " + i
